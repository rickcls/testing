    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Oat, Stone, Forest Green, Terracotta Accent) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a top-down, non-linear navigation structure. A sticky header allows users to jump to any relevant section (Foundations or specific age-based Life Stages) at any time. This is more user-centric than a linear report, as users can immediately access content relevant to their age and interests. The structure prioritizes interaction: key data points are transformed into interactive charts and calculators (e.g., Compounding Simulator, Budget Allocator) to promote exploration and deeper understanding. Each life stage is presented as a self-contained "dashboard" with consistent layouts (cards for goals/challenges, charts for data, accordions for strategies) to make complex information digestible and comparable across stages. This design transforms passive reading into an active learning experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Data from the report is visualized to enhance understanding. Report Table (Compounding effect) -> Goal: Show change over time -> Viz: Interactive Line Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: User selects starting age/savings rate to see dynamic growth curves, making the abstract concept of compounding tangible. Report Table (50/30/20 rule) -> Goal: Inform proportions -> Viz: Donut Chart + Input Field (Chart.js/HTML) -> Interaction: User enters income, chart updates to show personalized budget, making the rule actionable. Report Table (Setbacks/Concerns) -> Goal: Compare categories -> Viz: Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover tooltips provide exact percentages, making complex data easy to compare. Report Text (Strategies) -> Goal: Organize dense text -> Presentation: Accordion (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: User clicks to reveal detailed info, preventing information overload and improving readability. This approach systematically converts static data and text into engaging, interactive components. -->
